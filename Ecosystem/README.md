This is the code for an ecosystem where creatures live their life on full autonomous mode. There are two types of creatures, herbivores and carnivores. The herbivors eat plants, while the carnivors eat the herbivores. The creatures, when reached a specific amount of energy strart looking for mates and so a new creature is brought in ecosystem with mixed genes from both parents.
This is a project inspired from the book "nature of code" by Daniel Shiffman. 
Here is all my progress of the software so far.
Made by me, Donat Salihu.
Enjoy!

Eco7 is currently the last version of the ecosystem!
